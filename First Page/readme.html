 <blockquote class="yellow"><p class="p"><strong>Info:</strong> You can delete "/Resources/readme.css, /Resources/readme.js and /First Page/readme.html" after you're done reading. (or hide it from the public/see what's the code in the files above)<br><br>If some SVGs (the toilet SVG) appears as an unrendered image, refresh the page, if it doesn't work, keep repeating, or exit the page and go back in.<br><br><strong>Use this page as an example.</strong> If you have code you possibly cant understand or need to know how the code works, please contact me on Discord.</p></blockquote>
